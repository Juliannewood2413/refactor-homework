The main challenge of this homework was to update the elements of the included html and css pages and make them more semantic. 
There were no changes to the overall look of the website, and all changes focused on the code itself. 
During this assignment I focused on changing appropriate <div> tags to <section> tags to better differentiate between sections.
I also checked to make sure the page links were working, and fixed any that were not. 
In the css file I condensed/combined elements and reduced the overall css code from in the 200s to 139, including comments.
